##Using tfk8s
As a part of the IBM stack automation we need to convert the manifest file as part of the terraform code
Hashicorp suggests going with an open source tool named "tfk8s",tfk8s converts kubernetes manifest file to HCL without much efforts.

##Procedure

1.We need to install tfk8s
- https://github.com/jrhouston/tfk8s
- Describes the procedure to install it

2. This requires kubernestes_manifest as the provider
   - Reference Link ;- https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs/resources/manifest

3. Convert existing k8 manifest to HCL using tfk8s
- cat nginx.yml | tfk8s > nginx.tf

4. Terraform plan and apply will deploy the pods.

5. Verify the output
kubectl get pods --namespace test
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mypod   1/1     Running   0          53s


My POC notes
----------------
I was able to convert sample pod deployment manifest to HCL format using tfk8s
Using Terraform I was able to deploy the pod.
